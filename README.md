# Crappy JSON parser

As all lazy people do when they implement something just for the sake of understanding it, they don't follow any convention and spec.

Usage: can take stdin, or pass file in the 1st param.

## Implementation

Followed https://www.json.org/json-en.html.

Love the simplicity of railroad diagrams, instead of YAML (shudders).
