# Crappy JSON parser

As all lazy people do when they implement something just for the sake of understanding it, they don't follow any convention and spec.
So this is a quacko parser.
I am not parsing non-UTF8 string.
I will include JSON comment, why did they remove it?

## Implementation specification

https://www.json.org/json-en.html.

Love the simplicity of railroad diagrams, instead of the whole books and editions YAML spec is selling.
